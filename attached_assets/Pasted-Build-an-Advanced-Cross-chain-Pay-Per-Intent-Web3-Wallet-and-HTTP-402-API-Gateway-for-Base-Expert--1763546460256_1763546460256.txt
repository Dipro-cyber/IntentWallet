Build an Advanced Cross-chain, Pay-Per-Intent Web3 Wallet and HTTP 402 API Gateway for Base (Expert Blockchain & UI/UX Level).

As an expert blockchain engineer and UI/UX designer, create a professional full-stack dApp using Solidity, Node.js, and React for the Base network and x402 protocol. The project should demonstrate both technical sophistication and user-centric interface design.

Design and implement a smart contract wallet (ERC-4337 compatible) that processes intents from human users and autonomous AI agents.

Integrate advanced intent parsing (mock LLM logic, for now) to transform user/agent requests (e.g., “swap 2 ETH to USDC with <0.5% slippage”, “fetch top NFT mints last hour”) into contract or API actions.

Apply HTTP 402 pay-per-use flows: backend should respond with HTTP 402 Payment Required and dynamic USDC pricing for each request.

Enable seamless, instant one-time payment with Base wallet integration (MetaMask/Base); after payment, unlock API/data/endpoints (e.g., analytics access, protocol execution, NFT mint).

Architect a React dashboard that exemplifies modern UI/UX best practices—intuitive intent composition, clear payment dialogs, transaction confirmations, access history, and live analytics display.

Smart contract logic must securely custody funds, validate payments, emit on-chain proofs of access, and optionally support MEV/privacy protection on high-value actions.

Backend should provide pluggable API endpoints (mock and live, e.g., NFT mint API, real price oracle query) for demo and extensibility.

Prioritize extensibility for integration of new features (multi-chain routing, zk-proofs, subscription/paywall modules).

Deploy and host the frontend React app on Vercel, with automated deployments linked to a GitHub repository.

Provide deployment scripts/configurations for both Vercel and GitHub CI/CD pipelines.

Expert Notes:

Use Solidity 0.8.x and demonstrate Base L2 deployment or simulation on testnet.

Structure backend with advanced Node.js/Express patterns, frontend in React/TypeScript with TailwindCSS for sleek styling.

Implement wallet flows that clearly distinguish between human users and agents (simulate both).

Design interface flows for instant pay-per-intent unlock, prioritizing minimal friction and clear feedback.

Scaffold to showcase extensible plugin architecture for future tracks (cross-chain, NFT/data marketplaces, privacy relays).

Project Goal:

Present a sophisticated, best-practices Web3 solution showing how HTTP 402-powered, pay-per-use wallet actions—driven by clear, expert-designed interfaces—unlock frictionless, granular, and privacy-preserving access to data, DeFi, NFTs, and APIs on Base. Highlight seamless onboarding for humans and autonomous agents, with reliable and scalable deployment via Vercel for frontend hosting
